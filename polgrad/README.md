All code in this subset of the repo is attributed to the tremendous works in the following papers:
1. Robust control design for linear systems via multiplicative noise (https://github.com/TSummersLab/robust-control-multinoise)
2. Learning optimal controllers for linear systems with multiplicative noise via policy gradient (https://github.com/TSummersLab/polgrad-multinoise/)
